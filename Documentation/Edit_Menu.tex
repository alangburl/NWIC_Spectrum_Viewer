\section{Edit Menu}
The only option is Calibrate Spectrum. This will launch a new window, seen in Figure \ref{fig:calibrate_window}. The main widget features the same functions as that of the calibrated spectrum viewer. The dotted black line that appears is used to track the cursor to help in the identification of peak centroids. Double-right clicking with initiate a input dialog that will take the energy of the peak in MeV. This will be added to the widget on the left-hand side. Double-left clicking will remove the peak-channel pair. There is no limit to the numer of peaks that can be selected, but a minimum of two are required. This window has one drop down in the menu bar:

	\subsection{Load New Spectrum}
		This will load the per channel counts in the spectrum. Takes plain texts files as the argument. It expects a single column of data.

	\subsection{Calibrate}
		This loads a drop down menu with the following options:
				\subsubsection{Linear}
				Performs a linear least squares regression, ultimately resulting in the calibration being in the form of:
				\begin{equation}
				 	y=mx+b
				\label{eq:linear}
				\end{equation}
				\subsubsection{Deviation Pairs}
				Conducts a linear least squares fit, the determines the devaition from this at the known points to create and scale each data point. This can be used to generate a non-linear calibration.
				\subsubsection{External Calibration}
				Used if a known slope and intercept are to be input. It will fit the calibration to equation \ref{eq:linear}.
				\subsubsection{Segmented Linear}
				Fits a linear between each successive point of the inputs.
	\subsection{Save Calibration}
	Will save a single column of that relate the channel to calibrated energy as a plain text file(.txt) to the specified location.
